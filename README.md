Inuvik
======

A click-and-point adventure game engine written in Ruby with the help of Gosu. As the software is currently in the alpha stage,
it is extremely unpolished and not very well-documented. However, if you must use it now, you may find the path "./lib/rooms/"
to be useful.

You may also take a look at Yingge, a more experimental counterpart of Inuvik.
